We need to build a next.js application for an organization called VaporWatch.
Before beginning I will provide you with all of the necessary background information. Respond with a confirmation that you have received this information.
I will supply you with the next instruction immediately after your confirmation.
## Background:
- The web application provides private chat rooms.
- Any user can create a new a room.
- Users can join a room by room name and password.
- Any user can submit a message to the chat.
- The chat history can be cleared by any user at any time.
- The chat history is also cleared when any user leaves the room.
- You will play the role of expert full-stack developer. You will take guidance from me in building the application step by step.  I will offer target goals and you will create and enact a plan to achieve this goal.
## Coding Preferences
- We will be using Next.js, React, Tailwind, and Vercel for this application.
- We will store chat messages in Superbase.
## Functionality
- The application will be composed of 2 mobile responsive pages.
- The pages will have a shared nav bar and footer.
- The first page will be for choosing to create a new room or join an existing room.
- To create a room the user will need to provide a Room Name, Room Password, and User Display Name.
- To join a room the user will need to provide a Room Name, Room Password, and User Display Name.
- The second page will provide an interface for posting chat messages, view the history of chat messages, leaving the room, and clearing chat history.
- Use the attached image as a reference.

## VaporChat Visual Identity
1. Typography: Controlled Explosion
Concept: Sharp contrast between rational order and emotional rupture.
Primary Typeface:
 Modern grotesque sans-serif — e.g., Neue Haas Grotesk, Söhne, or Inter Tight.
 Clean, neutral, cerebral — the before of the mind-blow.
Accent Typeface:
 Expressive experimental serif or display font — e.g., Whyte Inktrap, Canela, or Grifinito L.
 Use it sparingly, like a visual “boom” in a headline or focal word.
Play with Scale & Contrast:
 → Giant, oversized words next to small ones.
 → Sudden weight changes (Extra Bold → Thin).
 → Tight vs. loose kerning.
 These typographic ruptures mirror the :exploding_head: moment.
2. Color Palette: Voltage & Revelation
Core Mood: High-contrast, high-emotion. A mix of neon intensity and void-like calm.
Palette ZoneColorUsageBase / BackgroundOff-black #0D0D0D or deep indigo #0E0A1ACalm before the explosionPrimary AccentElectric magenta #FF1FF0 or acid lime #C4FF1AThe “shock” momentSecondary AccentCyan #00FFFF or searing orange #FF4D00Adds vibrancy and energyHighlight / RevelationPure white #FFFFFF or pale silver #F2F2F2Clarity after impactDesaturated NeutralsCharcoal #222222, Warm gray #AAAAAAAnchor for balance
Tip: Use dark fields with sudden bursts of color — light emanating from darkness, symbolizing insight emerging from confusion.
3. Composition & Layout: The Moment of Impact
Tension & Release:
 Use asymmetric layouts — one side dense, the other minimal. This creates a sense of cognitive friction.
Visual Hierarchy as Narrative:
 Lead the viewer from confusion → focus → revelation. The eye should experience a “mind-blown” journey.
Motion (if digital):
Micro-animations that burst or ripple when hovered.
Sudden bright flashes or rotations that settle into clarity.
Smooth transitions from chaos to structure.
4. Imagery & Texture: Fracture + Flow
Imagery: Abstract explosions, light bursts, neural-like patterns, or data glitch art.
Texture: Mix organic (ink, smoke, energy waves) with digital (glitch, noise, gradient meshes).
Contrast: Pair smooth vector forms with grainy or fractal overlays.
5. Iconography & Graphics
Style: Geometric, line-based, minimalist — but occasionally ruptured (broken lines, distorted edges).
Symbolism: Think neurons, lightning, expanding circles — metaphors for thought and revelation.
6. Sound / Motion Identity (if multimedia)
Sound design = rising frequencies, static bursts, silence → boom → calm clarity.
Motion = slow zooms, expanding light, dissolving fragments coalescing into meaning.
7. Brand Tagline Visual Treatment
“Make Them Say Whoa.”
Type in uppercase grotesque sans.
Explode one letter (e.g., the O as a radial burst).
Animate the “O” pulsing outward — like a visual thought detonating.
